# Dark Warrior

_"The Baron pumped our boy here full of Dark Eco, and it did something to him. Now he's got super moves or something...and a few anger issues as well."_

## Who are the Dark Warriors?

It turns out that if you continually inject small amounts of dark eco into people as a form of torture for a long enough period of time, rather than killing them, it'll cause them to transform and seemingly lose control of themselves in a explosive rage whenever they get pissed off. If you encounter a dark warrior, it is certain that they were, at some point in their past, imprisoned. This should be no cause for worry though because the barrons will put anyone that resists their tyranny in those hell holes. 

## Ability Overview

Once you get passed the anger issues, this class is all about destroying everything in site. If you are in a party with a dark warrior, stay behind them... perhaps hide under something really heavy as well. Dark warriors are great fighters, even when they haven't transformed; once that happens though, it is like fighting against the raw power of dark eco.
