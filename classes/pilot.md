## Who are Pilots?

Being able to get places within the world is kind of a cool ability. Unfortunately, with much of the world laid out as uninhabitable wastelands, getting to remote locations requires a bit of extra skill, especially since all of these damned vehicles hover above the ground rather than having wheels for some unknown reason. Besides, we can't just use rifts to go everywhere, that's expensive and requires a bunch of setup. Drivers have the know-how to operate most machinery. 

## Abilities
