# Sage
_"I have spent my life searching for the answers that my father and my father's fathers failed to find. Who were the Precursors? How did they harness Eco, the life energy of the world?"_

## Who are the sages?

The sage is a student of the eco. They have chosen a specific color to study; this decision has defined their entire life. In general, a sage is very ludite and in touch nature. While the vast potential of eco is harnessed every day within the technologies that drive the many planets, sages prefer to observe the effects that exposure to pure, raw eco is able to provide.

## Ability Overview

One of the major advantages of being a sage is the fact that as they become more in touch with the the eco of their specialization, they are able to channel massive amounts of the stuff using their life energy. It is suspected that many sages may even communicate with the life force of anything dependant on their eco type.
