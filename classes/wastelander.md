# Wastelander 

_"I hate those survivalist assholes."_

## Who are the wastelanders?

Rather than sparing the resources to reform citizens that rebel against them, many of the major cities simply choose to abandon their undesirables in the wastelands. Those that survive long enough to be picked up by a crew, or to find one of the wasteland cities may call themselves a defacto wastelander. Life in the wastelands is hard and those that are thrown into it unwillingly generally do not survive. Still though, cities like Spargus and Kras are beacons to anyone that wishes not to die at the hands of the environment.

## Overview

Most wastelanders have spent many years outcast from fully resourced societies, as such, they are highly resistant to the effects of the environment, thick skulled, and usually blow up anything that they can't recognize.
