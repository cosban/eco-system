# Eco 
_"See those gears, boys? See how they're not moving? That means our village has no eco!"_

Eco is a terribly powerful substance that occurs naturally within many of the planets. It can be seen in the form of a gas, liquid, ore, crystal and even beams. Six different colors of eco are known, they are green, yellow, red, blue, dark and light eco. Each color of eco posesses different and specific properties. Some colors, like light eco, are rarer than others. Living beings are able to channel and activate abilities that eco unlocks to some ability. A vast majority of the sentient world is unable to do this though, so they rely on eco based technologies to help ease the burden of survival.

## Green Eco

Green eco contains the energy of life. If a living being is hurt, green eco may be used to speed up the healing process. Those that are able to channel green eco may use it to heal themselves or others with a greater effect. Since it has such an ability to counteract damage on living beings, all attempts at creating green eco weapons have resulted in failure... it simply seems to refuse to let anything die around it.

## Blue Eco

Blue eco contains the energy of motion. Think speed or electricity. Vast cities have been built, powered by eco grids overflowing with blue eco. Players with the ability to channel blue eco may find that they are able to move faster within its presence. Weapons that have been made with it have a high rate of fire, though they do considerably less per action than other eco types. Blue eco is even used within vehicles as fuel.

## Red Eco

Red eco contains the essence of strength and force. As civilization began to form, it was one of the first eco types to be weaponized. Warriors would channel and consume the eco to become incredibly strong, having the ability to lay down multiple enemies in one blow. As technology was further developed, the weapons associated with it always tended to have area of effect abilities. Using this type of eco comes at a cost though; much like how blue eco makes you faster, but generally weaker, red eco will make its user stronger but slower.

## Yellow Eco

Yellow eco contains projectile energy. Though red eco was the first eco to be weaponized, yellow eco is what makes up a majority of weapons. People channeling it have been seen throwing projectiles with their mind. Weapons using it are able to fire with a standard rate of fire and strength. Not much else has been done with yellow eco in the current age though the potential for it to do more does exist.

## Dark Eco

Dark eco is the most common eco in the universe. It contains the energy of chaos and destruction. Not many beings are able to channel dark eco. Those that have attempted to do so generally come out permantantly mutated if they survive. Weapons have been made with the ability to use this form though. When used, dark eco weapons are able to manipulate physical laws or forms within a small region. Gravity can be temporarily counter-acted, enemies can be stunned, or even reduced to a viscous ooze if enough of it is baraged at them. 

## Light Eco

Light eco is the rarest form of eco. As such, there are legends of entities able to channel and summon the substance directly from the earth without the need to harvest or mine it. Light eco contains the essence of palance purity. When used, light eco can be manipulated in order to counter-act the effects of other types of eco.
